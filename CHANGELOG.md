### Added

### Fixed

### Changed

### Removed

## [0.3.1] - 2023-01-18

### Added

### Fixed

### Changed

- ACVM compile method now returns an Error for when a function cannot be reduced to arithmetic gates

- Backtrack changes from noir-lang/noir/587

### Removed

## [0.3.0] - 2022-12-31

### Added

- Added stdlib module to hold all of the standard opcodes
- added `read` , `write` methods for circuit

### Fixed

### Changed

- XOR, Range and AND gates are no longer special case. They are now another opcode in the GadgetCall
- Move fallback module to `stdlib`
- Optimizer code and any other passes will live in acvm. acir is solely for defining the IR now.
- ACIR passes now live under the compiler parent module
- Moved opcode module in acir crate to circuit/opcode
- Rename GadgetCall to BlackBoxFuncCall
- Rename opcode file to blackbox_functions . Similarly OPCODE is now BlackBoxFunc
- Renamed GateResolution::UnsupportedOpcode to GateResolution::UnsupportedBlackBoxFunc
- Renamed GadgetDefinition to FuncDefinition
- Rename GadgetInput to FunctionInput
- Rename Gate -> Opcode . Similarly gate.rs is now opcodes.rs
- Rename CustomGate::supports_gate -> CustomGate::supports_opcode
- Rename GateResolution to OpcodeResolution
- Rename Split directive to ToBits
- Field element printing function was modified to uses ascii superscript numbers and ascii multiplication
- Refactor the way we print ACIR (This is a first draft and will change with more feedback)
- Rename `solve_gadget_call` trait method on ProofSystemCompile to `solve_blackbox_function_call`
- API for `compile` now requires a function pointer which tells us whether a blackbox function is supported
- Renamed Directive::Oddrange to Directive::OddRange
- Renamed FieldElement::to_bytes to FieldElement::to_be_bytes

### Removed

- Selector struct has been removed as it is no longer being used. It is also not being used by Noir.
- CustomGate trait -- There is a method in the ProofSystemCompiler Trait that backends can use to indicate whether
they support a particular black box function
- Remove OpcodeResolution enum from pwg. The happy case is strictly when the witness has been solved

## [0.2.1] - 2022-12-23

- Removed ToBits and ToBytes opcode
